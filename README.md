# VRTS_DIBR_Image_dataset
The DIBR synthesized image quality assessment driven by State Kay Lab of VRTS, Beihang University

## Dataset
The proposed VRTS DIBR Image dataset is conducted by State Key Lab. of VRTS, Beihang Univeristy in July, 2018. We selected 12 reference scenes, a total of 336 distorted images were generated with seven DIBR algorithms.

The subjective scores are available for all researchers interested in DIBR IQA, please contact us without hesitation: <wangxc@buaa.edu.cn>

## Benchmark
We have tested several IQA metrics on our new dataset, including BRISQUE, NIQE, CNNIQA, MFIQA which are designed for traditioanl 2D images, and 3DSwiM, MP-PSNR, MW-PSNR, NIQSV+ and APT, which are designed for DIBR synthesized images. We also proposed a novel end-to-end synthesized image quality assessment with contextual multi-level feature pooling (SIQA-CFP). The work is submitted to ICIP2019. The original code of our work will be made public when the review decision is determined.
